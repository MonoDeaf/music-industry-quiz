const questions = [
    {
        question: "What does DAW stand for?",
        options: ["Digital Audio Workspace", "Digital Audio Workstation", "Digital Audio Writer", "Digital Audio Workshop"],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "DAW stands for Digital Audio Workstation. It's a software application for recording, editing, and producing audio files. Modern DAWs are complete production environments that can handle everything from recording to mixing and mastering."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the typical value for unity gain?",
        options: ["0 dB", "+3 dB", "-3 dB", "+6 dB"],
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "Unity gain is 0 dB, which means the output signal is exactly the same level as the input signal - no amplification or attenuation. This is important for maintaining proper signal levels through an audio chain."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the correct term for 20,000Hz?",
        options: ["20dB", "20kHz", "20kz", "20,000Khz"],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Hz (Hertz) is a measure of frequency vibrations up to 1,000 cycles per second. Frequency vibrations over 1,000 cycles per second are referred to as kHz (Kilohertz). 500Hz, 1.2kHz (1,200Hz), 80Hz, 12kHz (12,000Hz)."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the average frequency range of human hearing?",
        options: ["250Hz - 12kHz", "5Hz - 48kHz", "75Hz - 10kHz", "20Hz - 20kHz"],
        correct: 3,
        explanation: "The average frequency range of human hearing is 20Hz to 20kHz. As we get older, our frequency hearing range can reduce to about 16kHz. Fun fact: whales communicate at 90kHz, which is so high in frequency that humans cannot hear it."
    },
    {
        question: "What does the term 'attenuate' mean?",
        options: ["Lower in volume and force", "Amplified in volume and force", "Increasing in speed", "Slowing down in speed"],
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "When we attenuate a sound, we are decreasing it's volume and force."
    },
    {
        question: "Phase shift and phase rotation are the same thing.",
        options: ["True","False"],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Phase shifts occur in the time domain. In a DAW, this could be represented by the entirety of the waveform moving toward the left or right, or up and down the frequency range. Phase rotation relates to the peaks and troughs of a waveform. For example, inverting the polarity of a signal by 180-degrees."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the purpose of dithering?",
        options: ["Reduce the bit-depth of the signal", "Smooth out quantization errors during bit depth reduction", "Increase render quality", "Reduce aliasing in digital audio"],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Dithering is used in digital audio to minimize the distortion that occurs when reducing the bit depth of a signal. By adding a small amount of noise, dithering helps to smooth out guantization errors, making the resulting audio sound more natural and reducing artifacts. In short, use dithering when rendering an audio as an mp3 file."
    },
    {
        question: "Which of the following compressors has the quickest available attack and release settings?",
        options: ["1176/FET", "LA2A/Opto", "G-Comp/VCA Bus Compressor", "STA Level/Tube Compressor"],
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "The 1176 FET compressor's attack and release can be as fast as 20 microseconds and 50ms. The compressor can react so fast to the input signal that it omits an audible distortion effect, making it a popular choice by audio engineers to add 'grit' to guitars and basses."
    },
    {
        question: "If editing is referred to as 'destructive', what does this mean?",
        options: ["The editing makes it sound worse", "The editing introduces unwanted artifacts and distortion to the signal", "The editing makes permanent changes to the audio file", "The editing will break your gear"],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "Destructive editing changes the original file on the hard drive."
    },
    {

        options: ["The initial rise of the sound from silence to peak level", "The level of the sustained sound", "The speed at which the sound fades out", "The rate at which the sound decays after the sustain"],
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "The 'attack' parameter controls the initial rise of the sound from silence to peak level. A fast attack is great for plucks, while a slow attack is essential for pads."
    },
    {
        question: "What does the 'release' parameter in an ADSR envelope control?",
        options: ["The peak level of the sound", "The amount of filtering applied to the sound", "How long it takes for the sound to fade to silence after the key is released", "The pitch modulation of the sound"],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "The 'release' parameter controls how long it takes for the sound to fade to silence after the key is released."
    },
    {
        question: "The 'D' in ADSR stands for ____.",
        options: ["Deliver", "Decay", "Distance", "DAW"],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Attack - Decay - Sustain - Release."
    },
    {
        question: "Which type of filter allows low frequencies to pass through while attenuating high frequencies?",
        options: ["High-pass", "Low-pass", "Band-pass", "Notch filter"],

        explanation: "A low-pass filter allows low frequencies to pass through, while cutting high frequencies."
    },
    {
        question: "What does a resonance knob typically control on a filter?",
        options: ["The slope of the filter cutoff", "The frequency range the filter affects", "The boost around the cutoff frequency", "The amplitude of the input signal"],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "The resonance knob boosts at the cutoff frequency. A higher resonance adds more of a profound filtering affect for the filter."
    },
    {
        question: "Frequencies below 20Hz are typically referred to as what?",
        options: ["Ultrasonic", "Subsonic", "Supersonic", "Bass"],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Frequencie below 20Hz are typically referred to as subsonic, as they are more 'felt' than heard."

    },
    {
        question: "In MIDI, what does 'velocity' refer to?",
        options: ["The speed at which a note is released", "The pitch of the note", "The time signature of the track", "The volume or intensity of a note"],

        options: ["To apply reverb to a signal", "To ensure a signal does not exceed a set threshold", "To expand the dynamic range of a signal", "To add distortion to a signal"],
        correct: 1,

        correct: 3,
        explanation: "Gain-staging is the process of monitoring levels throughout each entry and exit points of sends in the signal processing chain, to ensure the signal is not 'too hot' at any point."

        explanation: "Audio interfaces convert analog audio information, such as waveforms, into digital information for the computer to read. Speakers can't read 1's and 0's that comes from the computer, and computers can't read analog waveforms that comes from recording vocals, so audio infaces convert information for both to read. This process is called D/A (Ditigal to Analog) Conversion or A/D (Analog to Digital) Conversion."
